  "homeDescription": "Today is the 1000th day from 27th of November, 2016; the day when we were sitting on the katta in front of banks in Vishal Nagar to decide our future.\nThe day we confessed our affection towards each other. It was one of the happiest day in my life. Also it was the most important day in our lives; even more important than our wedding day. Because that day glued us forever. Even if we wouldn't get married, we would be still together, just because that crossed legs date happened.\nI want us to remember this day. Which is why I have come up with this game called treasure-hunt. Once you begin this game, you will see a hint on this screen, which will lead you to a treasure. If you find it, you can unlock the code and screen will show you a hint to the next treasure. There are 7 treasures hidden in this house.\nAll the best. üëç",
